# Boilerplate Paid MCP Server

An example paid MCP server using [PaidMCP](https://github.com/getAlby/paidmcp) and the [official MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

This MCP server is designed to be used in combination with [Alby Bitcoin Payments MCP Server](https://github.com/getAlby/mcp) or another MCP Server that can make lightning payments.

## Tools

This boilerplate MCP server has 2 tools:

- `ask_riddle` is a free tool that returns a riddle
- `check_riddle` requires a payment of 21 sats to check your answer to a riddle

### Example

> Tell me an easy riddle

```
boilerplate_paid_mcp ask_riddle
{
  "tone": "easy"
}

-->

Here's an easy riddle for you:

What has to be broken before you can use it?

Take your time thinking about it! When you're ready with your answer, let me know and I can check if you got it right.
```

> an egg

```
boilerplate_paid_mcp check_riddle
{
  "riddle": "What has to be broken before you can use it?",
  "answer": "an egg"
}
-->

I see that checking your answer requires a Lightning payment! The riddle checking service is asking for a payment of 21 sats to verify your answer.
```

```
alby_mcp pay_invoice
{
  "invoice": "lnbc210n1p5xayredpggd5x2cmtypexjeryd3jjqctwwdmk2unpdcsx2em8np4q228a2ztxkwzaypvzrsh823qngmv97f2v9puwvtsadetypmutyscwpp5zqyd4rc55l9yux0qeau7plcjzp9ezyn695ld625jvwqxwa0c6d4qsp53cps0ra8qem9yswlr5unm0auuc3hlr8jmqsj48umcp3ayt4mastq9qyysgqcqpcxqyz5vqkxa73dcw49cckqcrh3kndnjhu4p2p8hyzvf0ymmvc3m4vtn6dp0sxcptmrqnd46ruau8k4pu3sg8yrz3yx608cxsfngv70hzxx00gggqw84ryn"
}
-->

Great! The payment was successful. Now let me check your riddle answer using the check riddle tool with the payment hash.
```

```
boilerplate_paid_mcp check_riddle
{
  "riddle": "What has to be broken before you can use it?",
  "answer": "an egg",
  "payment_hash": "1008da8f14a7ca4e19e0cf79e0ff12104b91127a2d3edd2a9263806775f8d36a"
}
-->

Perfect! The check riddle tool confirms that your answer is correct!

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your answer "an egg" is indeed the right solution to the riddle "What has to be broken before you can use it?"
